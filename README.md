Project Showcase for Keyur(coderkeyur)

This is a list of work done by me during my coding bootcamp at Case Western Reserve University. I had no background in coding before starting this bootcamp, so  my intial projects are not as polished. You can see the evolution in my work from my early days of coding. 

#Crystal Collector Game
Crystal Collector game is one of the first games I designed with bootstrap and some logic with javascript and Jquery.  

#Giphytastic
This is one of the first implementation of API into project.
